Hi, I'm GuanYu.

I'm a self-taught JavaScript developer.

I'm a believer of life long learning. When I decided to quit my mundane job and started to learn programming by myself, I knew there was no turning back. So I kept going in spite of occasional self-doubt and depression.

I am lucky that I'm living in a time in which there're endless resources for learning. I learn from online courses, blogs of tech gurus and open source projects. I believe anyone can make big career change if he or she applies the right methods. Luckily for all of us, we have them all within our reach!

Professor Barbara Oakley's [*Learning How To Learn*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) MOOC course helped me a lot in learning new skills quickly. Lydia Hallie's story on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lydiahallie/advice-from-a-19-y-o-girl-software-developer-88737bcc6be5) gave me a lot of inspiration and motivation. [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott)'s series of blog posts on functional programming helped me avoiding many pitfalls of software design and acquiring the best practices.

As far as learning, I believe we all have the resources we need to achieve what we want. A CS degree from an established university certainly says a lot about one's qualifications, but that's not the only way one can get the same expertise. I'll prove this point with my continuous progress!
